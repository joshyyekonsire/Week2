Conduct research to figure out some or all of the elements of each company’s technology stack. Check job openings/job descriptions, engineering blogs, and anything else that may have information about what the company uses to write/build it’s software products.

Record your findings in a google doc. If you can find information about why the company chose that stack, include that as well.
