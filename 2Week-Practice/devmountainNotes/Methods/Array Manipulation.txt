Array Manipulation

.push()
.push() allows you to add an item to the end of an array.
.pop() removes the last item from an array.
.shift() removes the first item from an array.
.unshift() allows you to add an item to the front of an array
.slice() makes a shallow copy of the array that itâ€™s chained on to. It takes two arguments, the starting and ending indices of the array you want to copy. The ending index is not included in what is copied. This method does not change the initial array.
.splice() is the most dynamic of all for editing arrays. It takes 3 arguments:
1.	The index at which we want to begin editing
2.	How many items to remove from the array
3.	Any values to replace at that index
.length All arrays have a length property by default.
 As the name would suggest this returns the length of the 
array. Remember that while arrays are zero indexed, length
 is not. For example:
